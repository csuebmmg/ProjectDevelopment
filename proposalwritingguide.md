# Proposal Proposal Writing Guide

_You are about to embark on one of the most important aspects of a master's
degree, the preparation of a master's proposal. At this stage you will be preparing a proposal for your proposal project.  We ask that you prepare the proposal in the manner below, consistent with many of the same requirements as the proposal that you will be writing. Treat this a trial run._

You are charged with writing a formal 
proposal of a critical investigation into design, and is to be written in a formal, scholarly manner in standard English. It is important that style, usage, and punctuation be consistent.

The professor and your committee must accept the individual and team project proposals in order for you to advance to candidacy. 

The quality of both the presentation and content of the finished proposal is a major consideration in its acceptance.  Your projects should demonstrate originality, appropriate organization, clear
 purpose, critical analysis, independent thinking, and accurate and complete documentation.

## IRB Approvals
You must get IRB approval for any activity in which you engage the help of others or document and evaluate their behavior for the purpose of academic publishing. This includes User testing and collecting data or feedback from users or subjects.

You do not need IRB approval for feedback from classmates that is not published in your proposal.

Approval of research protocol by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) is mandatory if research with human subjects is involved. This review is necessary to determine whether human subjects will be at risk and to protect their rights and welfare.

Any research involving experiments, questionnaires, surveys,
interviews, and similar methodology involves research with human subjects.

You should contact the IRB Coordinator early in your proposal planning process and should submit their completed application
(protocol) to the IRB at least two months before they plan to begin their research. Further information is available on the Office of Re- search and Sponsored Programs website at: www.csueastbay.edu/orsp/ (Click on the "Institutional Review Board" link.) If you have
questions not answered on their web pages, you may call the Office of Research and Sponsored Pro- grams (LI 2310) at: 510-885-4212.

## Preparation of the Manuscript

### Grammar and Standard
Usage As a reference for general rules of American usage for such things as sentence structure, word form,
pronoun usage, grammatical consistency and punctuation, students should refer to a grammar hand-
book such as The Bedford Handbook for Writers by Diana Hacker, the Keys for Writers by Ann Raimes, or the Prentice Hall Reference Guide to Grammar and Usage by Muriel Harris. These guides are currently recommenced by the writing skills staff of our English Department.

### Professional Stylebook
You should use " _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_, by Kate L. Turabian, University of Chicago Press

Use Chicago - Turabian style - See https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/01/.

Use only black ink. Do not end a page with the first line of a paragraph, and do not begin a page with the last line of a paragraph. This includes the References or Works Cited and the Appendices.

__Every Reference must have an In-text Citation, and every In-text Citation must have a Reference.__

The Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables and other lists should be displayed in 2 or 3
distinct columns. Use “Dot Leader” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOBZv2pnGzA to vertically align
page numbers in the Table of Contents and Lists.

Each Figure and Table must have an In-text Citation.

Place Captions for Tables above the Table. Place Captions for Figures below the Figure.

Use a “Section Break” between the Preliminary Pages and the Content Pages to allow for the 2 styles of
numbering. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_15SvSefpnY

To number the Preliminary Pages, use lower-case Roman numerals (ii, iii, iv) placed in the Footer,
Centered at the Bottom of the page, exception: do not show the " i " on the first (Title) page.
Number the Content Pages using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) placed in the Header, 1/2-1" from the top of
page at the Right Margin.

### Paper Stock

Paper must be 8 1/2" x 11", white, and of such quality as to ensure
re production of perfect copies. (Onion-skin or textured papers are unacceptable.) 20-24 lb. white or bright white paper (as found at 
professional copy centers) is acceptable. (You may use 28 lb. paper if you have colored illustrations.)

### Type, Fonts, Point Size, Styles
Your proposal should have a clean and simple look, without ornamentation or unnecessary complexity. Font, point size, and type style (use of boldface, italics, and underlining) must be consistent throughout the proposal. Changes in
font or point size are not permitted.

 The following fonts/point sizes (and their corresponding italic and bold typefaces) are approved for theses.

Courier (12 pt)
Geneva (10 pt)
Helvetica (12 pt)
Palatino (12 pt)
Times or Times Roman (12 pt)
Verdana (10pt)
Calibri (11pt)

### Spacing, Margins, Indention, and Alignment of Text

Double-space the text. See sections on "Quotations," "Footnotes," and "Appendices" for exceptions.

 Leave one space after each word, comma, colon, and semicolon.
  Leave two spaces after periods, question marks, and exclamation points. Either is acceptable, as long as the spacing is consistently the same throughout the document.

 To form a dash, use your program's command for a dash if it has one; otherwise, type two hyphens with no added space between. Do
 
not add a space to either side of a dash.


### Margins

All pages of your proposal must have the same margins. The left margin must be at least 1 1/2" to allow for binding area.

 The right margin must be at least 1".

 The top and bottom margins
must be at least 1 1/4".

Page numbers may be placed out- side these margins. See "Pagination Requirements."



### Indenting

Indent paragraphs five to eight spaces. Do not add extra spaces between paragraphs within sections of text. Also, see the section on "Quotation Requirements" for indent requirements.



### Alignment of Text Requirements
All text must be left aligned (jagged right edge).

### Pagination Requirements

Each page in the proposal (except the title page) should have a page number.



### Type of Numbering

Roman Numerals: Use lower case Roman numerals for the preliminary pages, beginning with "ii" for the page following the Title Page.

 Arabic Numbers: Use Arabic numbers for the balance of the proposal,
beginning with number "1" for the first page of text. From here on, the entire proposal should be numbered consecutively. This includes maps,
figures, illustrations, bibliography and appendices.

### Font

Use the same font, point size and style (no italic or bold) for page numbers (Roman and Arabic) as you use for the text of your proposal.

  Adjust the default setting for page numbers in your word-processing program to match the font and
 point size you have chosen for your proposal.

### Placement of Number on the Page

Roman Numerals: For the preliminary pages which require lower case Roman numerals ( I, ii, iii, iv, etc.) centered at the bottom of the page.

Arabic Numbers: For the other pages, beginning with the first
chapter of the text, the page number should be placed in the upper right-hand corner approximately 1/2" to 1" from the top of the page and 1" from the right margin. Use the number only. Do not add a header or ornamentation (parentheses, dashes, etc.).

The default position in most word-processing programs for centered and upper right-hand page numbers is usually acceptable. The page number should be at least 1/2"
from the body of the text.

Tip: If your word-processor does not have the ability to number pages in one file in two different places (e.g., the upper-right corner and at the bottom/center of the page), you could cut and paste the pages requiring Roman numerals into a separate file, then number these pages.

### Subhead Requirements

In general, you should follow the
recommended format for subhead sequencing in the stylebook you are using. We recommend, however, that you put three or four blank
 lines before subheads and two blank lines after subheads.

 Subheads that are centered carry more weight than subheads that are flush left. You may use a combination of all caps, bold, italic or under-lining to distinguish between different weights of subheads.

Whatever format you choose for subheads,
check to be sure that all subheads of the same weight are formatted in the same way.


### Quotation Requirements

For all quotations, use the same font and point size for the quotation as used in the main body of your proposal.

Block Quotations
Block quotation format is normally used for quotations of four or more lines of text within a single quote.
  Format extended quotations as block quotations. Single-space the block quotation and double-space
between quotation paragraphs. Also double-space between the quotation and the main body of the text.

Indent a block quotation five to
eight spaces from the left and right margins. (Center the quotation be- tween the margins.) If you wish,
you may also indent the beginning of a paragraph in a block quotation another five spaces.

### Footnote Requirements

Footnotes should be places at the bottom of the page for the citations made
 on that page.

## Requirements for Footnotes at the Bottom of the Page

Use the footnoting style of your word-processing program as long as the program provides a line separating the footnote from the text and left justifies the footnote. Single-space each footnote and double-space between footnotes. There should be at least 1/4" between the last line of the text and the line separating the footnote (1/2" is preferred). The lines separating the footnotes should all be the same length (1 1/2" to 2" is recommend- ed).

As a general rule, use the same font and point size as the main body of your proposal. If, however, you have extensive footnotes, you may reduce the footnote point size to 9 or 10 points. Whatever point size you select, use it for all the footnotes of your proposal.

### Proofreading

Your proposal should be
 carefully proofread BEFORE it is submitted

Check the following items:

All text references to be sure they are correct and complete in the
footnotes/endnotes and bibliography.  

All chapter headings and subheadings, as well as figure and table headings to be sure they are for-matted in the same way throughout your proposal.

The headings in your Table of Contents and Lists of Tables/
Figures to be sure they correspond to the headings as they appear in the body of the proposal.

Page breaks to be sure pages do not begin with the last line of a paragraph from the preceding page or end with the first line of a paragraph.

### Requirements for Charts, Figures, Graphs, Tables, etc.

The rule for charts, figures, graphs, tables, etc. is that they must be consistent with each other in style and have the same general look. All photocopies and digital images must be clean and sharp. They should use the same font and point size as the text of the proposal if possible.

#### Exceptions

If it is not possible to use the same font and point size as the text of the proposal (i.e., there is not enough
 room, or the item has been generated on another computer which does not have the same fonts), it is allowable to use a different font or a smaller/larger point size, as long as all the charts, figures, graphs, tables, etc. in the proposal use the same variations consistently.

For example, if a proposal has five maps with legends, the type sizes of the legends should match each other.  

Charts, figures, graphs, tables may also be placed vertically on the page if they will not fit horizontally. The page, however, should have the same margins as the rest of the proposal. If possible, (1) place the top or heading at the left margin with the bottom of the item at the right margin, and (2) place the page number so that it appears in the same place and with the same orientation as on all the other pages of your bound proposal.

Hand-written symbols and handdrawn table or graph lines must be made with black, permanent ink (not with ball-point or water soluble felt tip pen).

Hand-color work on maps/graphs must be done in permanent ink; do not use crayon, colored pencil, or felt tip pen.
