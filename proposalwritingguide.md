#Thesis Proposal Writing Guide

_You are about to embark on one of the most important aspects of a master's
degree, the preparation of a master's thesis. At this stage you will be preparing a proposal for your thesis project.  We ask that you prepare the proposal in the manner below, consistent with many of the same requirements as the thesis that you will be writing. Treat this a trial run._


You are charged with writing a formal proposal of a critical investigation into design, and is to be written in a formal, scholarly manner in standard English. It is important that style, usage, and punctuation be consistent.

The professor and your committee must accept the individual and team project proposals in order for you to advance to candidacy. The quality of both the presentation and content of the finished proposal is a major consideration in its acceptance.  Your projects should demonstrate originality, appropriate organization, clear purpose, critical analysis, independent thinking, and accurate and complete documentation.

## IRB Approvals
You must get IRB approval for any activity in which you engage the help of others or document and evaluate their behavior for the purpose of academic publishing. This includes User testing and collecting data or feedback from users or subjects.

You do not need IRB approval for feedback from classmates that is not published in your thesis.

Approval of research protocol by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) is mandatory if research with human subjects is involved. This review is necessary to determine whether human subjects will be at risk and to protect their rights and welfare.Any research involving experiments, questionnaires, surveys,interviews, and similar methodology involves research with human subjects.

You should contact the IRB Coordinator early in your thesis planning process and should submit their completed application(protocol) to the IRB at least two months before they plan to begin their research. Further information is available on the Office of Re- search and Sponsored Programs website at: www.csueastbay.edu/ orsp/ (Click on the "Institutional Review Board" link.) If you havequestions not answered on their web pages, you may call the Office of Research and Sponsored Pro- grams (LI 2310) at: 510-885-4212.

## Preparation of the Manuscript
###Grammar and Standard
Usage As a reference for general rules of American usage for such things as sentence structure, word form,pronoun usage, grammatical consistency and punctuation, students should refer to a grammar hand-book such as The Bedford Handbook for Writers by Diana Hacker, the Keys for Writers by Ann Raimes, or the Prentice Hall Reference Guide to Grammar and Usage by Muriel Harris. These guides are currently recommenced by the writing skills staff of our English Department.

### Professional Stylebook
You should use " _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_, by Kate L. Turabian, University of Chicago Press

### Paper Stock
Paper must be 8 1/2" x 11", white, and of such quality as to ensurere production of perfect copies. (Onion-skin or textured papers are unacceptable.) 20-24 lb. white or bright white paper (as found at professional copy centers) is acceptable. (You may use 28 lb. paper if you have colored illustrations.)

### Type, Fonts, Point Size, Styles
Your proposal should have a clean and simple look, without ornamentation or unnecessary complexity. Font, point size, and type style (use of boldface, italics, and underlining) must be consistent throughout the thesis. Changes infont or point size are not permitted. The following fonts/point sizes (and their corresponding italic and bold typefaces) are approved for theses.

Courier (12 pt)
Geneva (10 pt)
Helvetica (12 pt)
Palatino (12 pt)
Times or Times Roman (12 pt)
Verdana (10pt)
Calibri (11pt)

### Spacing, Margins, Indention, and Alignment of Text
Double-space the text. See sections on "Quotations," "Footnotes," and "Appendices" for exceptions. Leave one space after each word, comma, colon, and semicolon.  Leave two spaces after periods, question marks, and exclamation points. Either is acceptable, as long as the spacing is consistently the same throughout the document. To form a dash, use your program's command for a dash if it has one; otherwise, type two hyphens with no added space between. Do not add a space to either side of a dash.
### Margins
All pages of your thesis must have the same margins. The left margin must be at least 1 1/2" to allow for binding area. The right margin must be at least 1". The top and bottom marginsmust be at least 1 1/4".Page numbers may be placed out- side these margins. See "Pagination Requirements."

### Indenting
Indent paragraphs five to eight spaces. Do not add extra spaces between paragraphs within sections of text. Also, see the section on "Quotation Requirements" for indent requirements.

### Alignment of Text Requirements
All text must be left aligned (jagged right edge).

### Pagination Requirements
Each page in the thesis (except the title page) should have a page number.

### Type of Numbering
Roman Numerals: Use lower case Roman numerals for the preliminary pages, beginning with "ii" for the page following the Title Page. Arabic Numbers: Use Arabic numbers for the balance of the thesis,beginning with number "1" for the first page of text. From here on, the entire thesis should be numbered consecutively. This includes maps,figures, illustrations, bibliography and appendices.

### Font
Use the same font, point size and style (no italic or bold) for page numbers (Roman and Arabic) as you use for the text of your thesis.  Adjust the default setting for page numbers in your word-processing program to match the font and point size you have chosen for your thesis.

### Placement of Number on the Page
Roman Numerals: For the pre-liminary pages which require lower case Roman numerals ( I, ii, iii, iv, etc.) centered at the bottom of the page.

Arabic Numbers: For the other pages, beginning with the firstchapter of the text, the page number should be placed in the upper right-hand corner approximately 1/2" to 1" from the top of the page and 1" from the right margin. Use the number only. Do not add a header or ornamentation(parentheses, dashes, etc.).  The default position in most word-processing programs for centered and upper right-hand page numbers is usually acceptable. The page number should be at least 1/2"from the body of the text.

Tip: If your word-processor does not have the ability to number pages in one file in two different places (e.g., the upper-right corner and at the bottom/center of the page), you could cut and paste the pages requiring Roman numerals into a separate file, then number these pages.

### Subhead Requirements
In general, you should follow therecommended format for subhead sequencing in the stylebook you are using. We recommend, however, that you put three or four blank lines before subheads and two blank lines after subheads. Subheads that are centered carry more weight than subheads that are flush left. You may use a combination of all caps, bold, italic or under-lining to distinguish between different weights of subheads.

Whatever format you choose for subheads,check to be sure that all subheads of the same weight are formatted in the same way.

### Quotation Requirements
For all quotations, use the same font and point size for the quotation as used in the main body of your thesis.Block QuotationsBlock quotation format is normally used for quotations of four or more lines of text within a single quote.Format extended quotations as block quotations. Single-space the block quotation and double-spacebetween quotation paragraphs. Also double-space between the quotation and the main body of the text.Indent a block quotation five toeight spaces from the left and right margins. (Center the quotation be- tween the margins.) If you wish,you may also indent the beginning of a paragraph in a block quotation another five spaces.10. Footnote RequirementsFootnotes are usually at the bottom of the page for the citations madeon that page, although some departments require that the "notes" becollected at the end of each chapter or at the end of the text before the bibliography as endnotes. Follow the directions of your department for content, format, and placement of footnotes/endnotes.Footnotes or endnotes appearing within, or at the end of a chapter should be numbered beginning with number 1 for each chapter. If end- notes are placed at the end of the thesis before the bibliography, in-
clude the chapter headings on your endnotes pages followed by the notes pertaining to that chapter.This allows readers to easily find the notes pertaining to a particular chapter.Requirements for Footnotes at the Bottom of the PageUse the footnoting style of your word-processing program as long as the program provides a line sep- arating the footnote from the text and left justifies the footnote. Anyvariation from this standard format requires approval from the Office of Academic Programs and Graduate Studies.Single-space each footnote and dou- ble-space between footnotes. There should be at least 1/4" between the last line of the text and the line sep- arating the footnote (1/2" is pre- ferred). The lines separating thefootnotes should all be the same length (1 1/2" to 2" is recommend- ed).As a general rule, use the same font and point size as the main body of your thesis. If, however, you have extensive footnotes, you may re- duce the footnote point size to 9 or 10 points. Whatever point size you select, use it for all the footnotes of your thesis.11. ProofreadingThe University Thesis should becarefully proofread by the student and the studentï¿½s committee BE- FORE it is submitted to the Academ- ic Programs and Graduate Studies Student Services office for formatreview.Check the following items:ï¿½ All text references to be sure they are correct and complete in thefootnotes/endnotes and bibliog- raphy.ï¿½ All chapter headings and sub- headings, as well as figure and table headings to be sure they are for-
matted in the same way throughout your thesis. ï¿½ The headings in your Table of Contents and Lists of Tables/Figures to be sure they correspond to the headings as they appear in the body of the thesis. ï¿½ Page breaks to be sure pages do not begin with the last line of a par- agraph from the preceding page or end with the first line of a para- graph.12. Requirements for Special FormatsUniversity Theses of unusual size or shape, or those which include spe-cial information (for example, tape recordings, musical scores, lengthy music manuscripts) must have for- mat approval from the Academic Programs and Graduate Studiesoffice. Large maps (pre-folded by the student) or CD's can be inserted in sturdy pockets built by the bind- ery inside the back cover.One complete set of folded material must go to the bindery with the multiple copies so that they canbuild a pocket of the correct size.13. Requirements for Charts, Fig- ures, Graphs, Tables, etc.The rule for charts, figures, graphs, tables, etc. is that they must be con- sistent with each other in style and have the same general look. All photocopies and digital images must be clean and sharp. They should use the same font and point size as the text of the thesis if possi- ble.ExceptionsIf it is not possible to use the same font and point size as the text of the thesis (i.e., there is not enoughroom, or the item has been generat- ed on another computer which does not have the same fonts), it is allow- able to use a different font or a smaller/larger point size, as long as all the charts, figures, graphs, tables, etc. in the thesis use the same varia-

tions consistently. For example, if a thesis has five maps with legends, the type sizes of the legends should match each other.Charts, figures, graphs, tables may also be placed vertically on the page if they will not fit horizontally. The page, however, should have the same margins as the rest of the thesis. If possible, (1) place the top or heading at the left margin with the bottom of the item at the right margin, and (2) place the page number so that it appears in the same place and with the same ori- entation as on all the other pages of your bound thesis.Hand-written symbols and hand- drawn table or graph lines must be made with black, permanent ink (not with ball-point or water solu- ble felt tip pen).Hand-color work on maps/graphs must be done in permanent ink; do not use crayon, colored pencil, or felt tip pen. Each book must contain a complete set of any color illustra- tions.14. Requirements for Plates and PhotosIf your thesis includes photos or plates, one complete set of plates/ photographs must be submitted to the office with the original, depart- mentally approved copy of the Uni- versity Thesis by the thesis format review deadline. You may chooseone of the two following options:Option 1Include clear black and white orcolor digital images or photocopies of the photos, on the same thick- ness/type of paper as the rest of the thesis in each copy of the thesis submitted for binding.Option 2After the thesis has been bound, mount actual prints onto a cap-tioned page in each bound copy. To add photographic prints, the bind- ery requests that plates and photo-
graphs be mounted AFTER the the- sis is bound, to avoid bucklingcaused by uneven page thickness.If you choose this option, insert a captioned (but otherwise blank) page in the appropriate place(s) ineach copy of your thesis you submit for binding. You may contact the Valley Library Binding at 559-237- 5224 for specific instructions re- garding the use of stubbing sheets.When the bound copies are re-turned by the bindery, you will tear away the main portion of the perfo- rated stubbing sheet (leaving only the left edge in the spine to provide for the thickness of the plate/photograph) and will then mount the photo on the captioned sheet. It is suggested that you use an adhe- sive spray to mount your photos such as "Photo-Mount" manufac- tured by 3-M and available at Office-Max. Using tape to attach the pho- to or plate to the page is not ac-ceptable15. Printer SpecificationsONLY the following types of print- ers are approved for theses (use "best quality" mode for your final draft).ï¿½ Laser printers (preferred)ï¿½ Ink Jet printersï¿½ Letter Quality dot matrixUnacceptable Printersï¿½ Line printersï¿½ Dot matrix printers (not letter quality)ï¿½ Any printer with visible and/or unconnected dots forming a letter

                                    i. Title PageThe title page is mandatory and must be prepared according to the template at the end of this writing guide. Use the template attached as a printed guide to placement ofeach element on the page. Insert the same number of blank lines asindicated on the template. Text and decorative lines must be centered between the top, bottom and left and right margins. (Top and bottom margins must be at least 1 1/4".Left margin must be 1 1/2" and right margin must be 1".) Holdyour typed title page along with the printed template up to the light to align all text. Make adjust- ments as necessary.Notes:    o The title of your thesis and/or dissertation must not exceed 85 spaces (including thespaces between words and punctu- ation). Your title should be in allcapital letters.    o Decorative lines must be 1 1/2" long. (Theses only)o Check the University Cataloglist of "Graduate Degrees" for the official name of your degree (i.e., "M.S. in Biological Science," rather than "M.S. in Biology"). Do not use the name of the degree Option.    o The date on the title page should be the month and year the degree will be awarded (the last month of the quarter you are grad-uating). For example, summer quar- ter 2011 ends September 3, so your thesis should be dated "September 2011".    o The title page is counted as page "i" but do not type this num- ber on the page.o Alignment of the elements
on your title page will vary depend- ing upon the font, word-processing program and printer you are using. For this reason, if you copy and paste the online title page template into a word-processing program, the results may not match the tem- plate.ii. Copyright PageThe inclusion of a copyright page is optional, but highly recommended. The U.S. Copyright Office has infor- mation for completing the copy-right process at http:// www.copyright.gov/register/ literary.html. An additionalhandout is available from the Aca- demic Programs and Graduate Studies office. To format your copy- right page, choose one of the twofollowing options. In the middle of the blank copyright page center (vertically and horizontally) your name and the year of the publica- tion as follows:Option 1John Doe ï¿½ 2006Option 2Copyright ï¿½ 2006 by John DoeIf you do not have a font that in- cludes the copyright symbol, e.g.,"Symbol" font, you should type the "c" and draw a circle around it in permanent black ink.If included, this page is numbered with a lower case Roman numeral "ii" centered between the margins at the bottom of the page.iii. AbstractInclusion of an abstract is optional. An abstract is a definitive statement of the problem, a brief descriptionof research method and major find- ings, and conclusions. It is limited to one or two pages. Check withyour department and/or Thesis

Committee Chair to determine whether your thesis should have an abstract.If included, double-space the text and use the same margins as the body of your thesis. These pages must be numbered with lower case Roman numerals, centered be- tween the margins at the bottom of the page.iv. Approval (Signature) Page The approval page is mandatory and must be prepared according to the template at the end of this writ- ing guide.Use the template attached as aprinted guide to placement of each element on the page. Insert the same number of blank lines as indi- cated on the template. Left margin must be 1 1/2" and right margin must be 1". Hold your typed ap- proval page along with the print- ed template up to the light to align all text. Make adjustments as necessary.For Theses: The signature lines must be 2 1/2" in length and the date lines 2" in length as on the template.For Dissertations: The signature lines must be 4" in lengthAlso, the name of each committee member must be typed immediate- ly beneath his or her respectivesignature line. As with your title page, the alignment of the elements on your approval page will vary depending upon the font, word-processing program and printer you are using.This page must be numbered with a lower case Roman numeral, cen- tered between the margins at the bottom of the page.v. PrefaceInclusion of a preface is optional. In general, a preface is written to ex- plain the motivation for making the study, the background for the pro- ject, scope of the research, and pur-
pose of the paper.The preface should be double- spaced and have the same margins as the body of your thesis. It may also include some acknowledg- ments if the "Acknowledgments"section has been omitted. If includ- ed, this page must be numbered with a lower case Roman numeral centered between the margins at the bottom of the page.vi. AcknowledgmentsAcknowledgments are not re-quired, but a brief statement may be included to thank mentors, col- leagues, individuals or institutions that supported research, or to give credit to works cited in the text for which permission to reproduce has been granted. Students are cau-tioned to prevent their statement from being overly long or personal in nature. An appropriate acknowl-edgment includes thanking an insti- tution which sponsored an intern- ship.The acknowledgments should be double-spaced and have the same margins as the body of your thesis. If included, this page must be num- bered with a lower case Roman numeral centered between the margins at the bottom of the page.vii. Table of ContentsThe table of contents is mandatory and should have the same margins as the body of your thesis. Center the title "Table of Contents" at the top of the page and list all parts of the thesis except the blank pages, title page, and approval page. For the remainder of the table, follow the requirements of the stylebook of your professional field.Note: You should double-space between all the major section head- ings (i.e., Lists of Tables, Chapters, Bibliography, etc.). You may, single-space between subheads that are listed under the main headings. All columns must align neatlyï¿½ragged columns are not acceptable.
Sample Format:* Note: The column of page numbers is right-aligned. Page is not included.The table of contents must be num- bered with a lower case Roman numeral centered between the mar- gins at the bottom of the page(s).viii. Lists of Figures, Graphs, Pho- tos, Plates, Maps or TablesIf your thesis includes figures, graphs, photos, plates, maps or ta-bles, you must include these lists. Do not include any items that you have placed in an appendix in your Lists of Figures, Graphs, Photos, Plates, Maps or Tables. Place each list on a separate page and use the same margins as the body of your thesis. Center the title (i.e., "List of Tables" or "List of Figures") at the top of the page and list tables or figures with page numbers in aligned columns. In general, follow the requirements of the stylebook for your profes-sional field.You may choose to use the same format as the "Table of Contents"sample in the previous section. You should, however, double-space be- tween each itemï¿½i.e., figure or table heading. (You may single- space between the lines of the head- ing.) Note: columns must alignneatlyï¿½ragged columns are not acceptable.These lists must be numbered with

a lower case Roman numeral cen- tered between the margins at the bottom of the page(s).ix. TextThe main body of the thesis is usu- ally separated into well-defineddivisions, such as chapters, and may begin with a brief chapter enti- tled "Introduction," or simply start with Chapter One. Follow the re-quirements of the stylebook foryour professional field. Note: text must be double-spaced and printed on one side of the paper only.Begin numbering with Arabic nu- merals (starting with page 1) at the upper right corner of the page and continue numbering each page to the end of the thesis. See # 7, "Pagination Requirements" under General Format Requirements.x. EndnotesInclude this section only if notes were not in the text or at the end of chapters. Also see # 10, "Footnote Requirements" under General For- mat Requirements for additionalinformation on endnotes. Center the title "Notes" or "Endnotes" at the top of the page. In general, fol- low the requirements of the style- book for your professional field. Text within individual citations/ notes should be single-spaced, with double-spacing between each cita- tion/note. Students should refer to the stylebook of their profession for specifics. Endnotes must use the same font, font size and margins as the text of the thesis.xi. BibliographyThis section may be mandatory, depending upon requirements of the stylebook for your professional field. Center the title"Bibliography," "References," or ï¿½Works citedï¿½ at the top of the page and format the bibliography ac-cordingly. Text within individual citations should be single- spaced, but double-space be- tween each citation/note. Stu-dents should refer to the stylebook
of their profession for specifics. The bibliography must use the samefont and font size as the text of the thesis.xii. Appendix/Appendices Inclusion of appendices is optional. Items properly relegated to an ap- pendix are explanations and elabo- rations not essential to the work of the thesis, but helpful to a reader seeking further clarification. Some examples might include: texts ofdocuments or laws, long lists, ques- tionnaires and sometimes evencharts or tables. If charts or tables are placed in an appendix, they would not be included in your List of Tables or List of Figures at the beginning of your thesis.Do not place figures, tables,charts, graphs, photos or other work that is needed and directly supports the work of your thesis in an appendix.Materials of separate categories should be placed in separate ap- pendices. If there is more than one appendix, each should be given a number or letter: Appendix 1, Ap- pendix 2, etc., or Appendix A, Ap- pendix B, etc. Center the title of each appendix at the top of the page. Another option is to center the title on a separate sheet (in the middle of the page or at the top)immediately preceding the appen- dix.Items placed in an appendix should be named and numbered separate- ly from similar items in the body of your thesis. In general, format the appendices according to the re-quirements of the stylebook for your professional field.Note: All items (i.e., text, charts, graphs, tables, etc.) in the appen- dices must use the same font and font size as the text of the thesis. Text should be double-spaced. Ex- ceptions to this rule may be made as indicated under the appropriate section in the University Thesis
Writing Guide. For example, see "Requirements for Charts, Figures, Graphs, Tables, etc." for exceptions allowed in presenting tables. In addition, sample surveys, letters,questionnaires, etc. can be used in their original form.If the appendix includes charts/ graphs or other illustrations, they must be generally consistent with each other in style and presenta- tion.Begin numbering the appendices with the number which follows the last page of the previous section. If you are using items in their original form, these must be reduced to fit within the prescribed margins. You may choose to have a copy centerreduce these for you. Also if you are using items in their original form, white-out old page numbers andrecopy the item.
	
Make sure the typist has a copy of these instructions.Students who choose to hire a typ- ist to prepare the manuscript must ensure that the typist has theseinstructions before beginning the job. (The University Thesis Writing Guide is available online at http:// www.csueastbay.edu/thesiswritingguide.)Agree on all details before work begins.Neither the university nor any of its offices or departments is responsi- ble for matters concerning stu- dents' relationships or agreements with any outside agency or individ- ual; therefore, neither the Universi- ty nor any of its units will take part in disagreements between student and typist concerning services of- fered or expected (including costs billed or paid). It is wise for you and the typist to agree on all details,preferably in writing, before the work is begun. Such agreementsinclude the typist's estimate of cost (based on information from you) and an estimate of time needed to complete the typing, as well as an understanding of responsibility for any required retyping. You are ad-vised to examine the first few typed pages to make certain the typist uses proper format and produces professional copy. Do not wait until the job is finished to determinecompliance with standards and requirements.Allow time to complete each step involved in producing your the- sis.Allow time for your draft prepara- tion. A good typist types about eight pages an hour. Generally, only the most competent, professional typist is able to spend more than fourhours a day on a thesis. Also allow time for proofreading, for consider- ation by your University Thesis
Committee (a week or more), for making the inevitable corrections or additions, and for obtaining the signatures on the approval page of all your committee membersï¿½all before the format review deadline.Finding a typist.Typists sometimes advertise in the Cal State East Bay Pioneer newspa- per, or they may post notices of their services on bulletin boardsaround campus. Typists who spe- cialize in theses also advertise in the yellow pages under "Word- processing Services."
	
Submit Your Final CopyAt the first due date, you must submit your APPROVED FINAL COPY of your University Thesis to the Thesis Editor in the Office of Aca- demic Programs and Graduate Studies for format review. Students may turn in their thesis to Student Services and AdministrationBuilding, Room 4500. (Do not have your committee members sign the approval page until the Thesis Editor has completed the format review.) Your thesis must be typed according to theformat requirements in the University Thesis Writing Guide. It must also contain all mandatory sections, with optional sections included if appropriate. The thesis will be proofread for adherence to the re- quired format and returned to you for corrections.Revised/Multiple CopiesAt the second due date, you must submit your revised/multiple cop- ies, order the number of copies to be bound, and pay binding fees. After the multiple copies have been submitted and the binding fees paid, the graduation evaluators in Enrollment Services will be noti- fied that the thesis has been accepted.   You must meet both the "Format Review" deadline and the "Copies Due" deadline. These are firm deadlines.Please see the thesis deadlines website for dates to submit your the- sis for format review and to submit your revised, multiple copies:www.csueastbay.edu/thesiswritingguide
Changes in this version of the University Thesis Writing Guide include changes in procedures and format requirements. Students and faculty advisors should refer to these guidelines, rather than previously com- pleted theses.The Thesis Editor currently offers a Universi- ty Thesis Formatting Workshop each quarter at the Student Center for Academic Achieve- ment. This workshop is free and open to all grad students and advisers. Please contact the Office of Academic Programs and Gradu- ate Studies at 510-885-3716 for the day and time.Use the templates in the University Thesis Writing Guide as tools to help you determine whether your title page and approval page have been formatted correctly. Create atyped version using your word-processing program and following the instructions on the template. Insert the same number of blank lines as indicated on the templates.Hold your typed title or approval page up to the light along with a copy of the appropriate template to check alignment of all elements. Adjust the elements on your typed page to match the positions of the corresponding elements on the template.Note: Alignment of the elements on your typed pages will vary slightly dependingupon the font, word-processing program and printer you are using. Minor variations are acceptable.
