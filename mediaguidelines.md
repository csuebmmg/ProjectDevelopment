# MM Grad Media Guidelines & Specifications
The following is to serve as a reference for specific standards of media used in multimedia presentations throughout the various courses in the Multimedia Graduate Program, including second year thesis project development.  While it is difficult to include every single detail that pertains to producing the highest quality media possible, these guidelines and specifications aim to bring into sharp focus those details that have the most notable bearing on quality.

## Audio
●	Whenever possible, start with/record uncompressed audio
●	Sample rate/bit depth: 44.1kHz/16-bit minimum
●	If recording to sync to video, use 48kHz/16-bit minimum to reduce chances of drift and other sync issues
●	Voiceovers should be recorded in mono and panned center in the mix
●	Use a large diaphragm mic with a pop screen, standing at least 6-12” from the mic
●	Experiment with gain settings that place the level at about ¾ hot in the VU meter (this will leave headroom for additional mastering)
●	Soundtrack and foley must be mixed in stereo and 12dB or more lower than voiceover track (use headphones and studio monitors to judge)             
●	Apply signal compression (fx) to voiceover tracks to even them out.
●	Data compression (e.g. compress to MP3, AAC, or other format) is applied as a final step and options must be explored in the authoring program in order to ensure double compression isn’t occurring (compressing an already compressed sound file)
●	If your sound has that dull, “underwater” quality (especially with high frequency content) chances are it is over compressed
§  Any audio deemed unacceptable will be required to be redone

## Images
●	Do not stretch images or graphics or use images that are highly pixelated (especially as a result of stretching)
●	Maintain proper proportion through SHIFT+dragging when manipulating size
●	Ensure subject matter is properly composed, in focus and correctly exposed
●	Use appropriate image resolution (print versus screen resolutions)
●	Use appropriate image image formats - jpg, png, gif, svg/ .tif, .eps or .pdf
●	Use appropriate image color model - CMYK / RGB
●	Use appropriate image color profile - Adobe RGB (1998) / sRGB IEC61966-2.1
Typography/Type
●	As with images, don't stretch typefaces
●	Carefully compose overlays by avoiding competing type & busy backgrounds
●	Don't use display typefaces for body copy
●	Use appropriate font format for medium
●	Use web safe font choices for body copy content to ensure style consistency across computers and operating systems

## URLs
Print
●	Do not format for clicking (ie. lowercase, blue with underline), especially in documentation
§  This is often auto-formatted in Word and other programs; Disable or alter formatting using styesheets
●	Use MLA formatting for URL biblio references
§  See CitationMachine.net and the MLA Citation Generator for useful online citation tools

## PDF
●	URLs should be active
●	Video
●	Any onscreen reference to URLs must be to root level domains, without the http:// and not formatted for clicking (ie. lowercase, blue with underline)
§  Good: multimedia.csueastbay.edu
§  Bad: http://multimedia.csueastbay.edu/mmgsiteV2/ - it is way too long
●	You can also leave out the 'dub,' assuming it works: google.com instead of www.google.com
●	Emphasize semantics in longer URLs by using capital letters: MusicTeacherTools.com

## Video
●	Videos must be shot in HDV or other HD format
●	Where SD footage is used within an HD project: it must be letterboxed (not stretched) and smoothing should be applied, if available
●	See URLs above for formatting of URLs onscreen
●	Do not include a scrolling list of references at the end;
●	Final, rendered videos for web playback must adhere to the following specifications:
○	Size (W x H): 1280x 720 (square pixel)
○	Target Bit Rate: 4000 kbps
○	FPS: 30
○	Video codec: H.264 Video, millions of colors, key frame every 24-30 frames
○	Audio codec: AAC, 16 bit Stereo (LR), 48.000 kHz, Quality – Best
○	File format: .mov
○	Movies recorded at 1080i will need to be deinterlaced
○	Transcripts of video must be provided, along with timings, so that Closed Captions may be added later

Do not render an HD movie to an SD DVD; Burn to DVD as file, copy to presentation computer and play from computer instead

## Multimedia Presentations
●	Powerpoint and Keynote are allowed; The point is to create an effective presentation regardless of platform used
●	Speak clearly and don't read off of slides
●	Limit the amount of text to read per slide; Remember, slides are for illustrating points with media and imagery
●	Avoid competing backgrounds
●	Use high quality images and graphics according to the guidelines and standards set above
●	Minimize the use of canned effects, transitions, clip art, audio, and other media that comes stock with the software being used
●	Rehearse your presentation

## Documentation
●	When provided, use stylesheets that emphasize consistent formatting across the document
●	Establish and use a consistent page layout style
●	Include page numbers
●	Avoid the waste of color printing on running headers and footers that feature group logos or other unnecessary forms of trim
●	PDF documentation must feature an interactive table of contents with accurate linking to documentation pages
